    <h2 id="bio">About me</h2>
    <p>My name is Janine Pamintuan. 
    I am a born and raised in Philippines, now currently living in Brooklyn, New York.
    I am currently a stay at home mom, and soon to be full time student.
    I am mostly at home playing with my 2 y.o. daughter and cat, being a good wife and a mother to my family.
    I also like to read books, watch movies and tv series in my spare time.
    I am currently making some career changes, as I am about to start a coding boot camp.
    My husband is a software engineer and has been the insipiration behind my career change.
    I hope to gain so much knowledge in this new path that I'm about to take.</p>
    <h2 id="reco">Recommendations</h2>
    <p>Here's some of my tv series recommendations that I like watching; <br>
    Law and order:which features both a police investigation of a crime discovered during the cold open,
    and a prosecution case set forth by the New York County District Attorney, at the Manhattan DA's office. <br>
    <br>
    Gilmore girls: follows the lives of a 32-year-old single mother, Lorelai Gilmore and her intellectual teenage daughter Rory Gilmore whom she had at the age of 16.
    The two women, while living in the small town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, have big ambitions they desperately try to achieve:
    Lorelai wants to own her own inn, while Rory wants to attend Harvard University.
    They also deal with Lorelai's appearance-obsessive upper class parents, Emily Gilmore and Richard Gilmore in which the girls attend mandatory Friday night dinners with them. <br>

    <h2 id="food">Food</h2>
    <p>I think one of life's greatest pleasure is eating. I was born and raised in Philippines and we have amazing food.
    Here's some foods that I grew up eating: <br>
    Adobo: an authentic Filipino dish and is one of the mostly recognized Filipino foods.
    This dish is uniquely prepared by stewing meat of choice can be chicken or pork, in vinegar and soy sauce.<br> <br>
    Sinigang: a sour soup native to the Philippines. This recipe uses pork as the main ingredient.
    Other proteins and seafood can also be used. Beef, shrimp, fish are commonly used to cook sinigang.
